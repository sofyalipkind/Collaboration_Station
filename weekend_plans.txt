Prompt: What are my plans for the weekend? ALternatively, what do I WISH my plans were for the weekend?

For several weeks, a couple friends and I have been watching this one series via Zoom, and we may finish this Saturday! I'm very excited. 
Outside of that, I plan to go for a run, and I hope to catch up with another friend if I have time left over after classwork.
